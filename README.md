## Abstract
We are going to use deep learning models to predict which subject does a paper belong to based on its abstract. Subjects include Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Statistics, Biology, and Finance. We plan to use two models to train our dataset, tune each model invidually, and compare the accuracy rate of each model.


## Models

Model 1: BERT is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. It works really well in scenarios like sentiment analysis, translation, and text classification.
