## Abstract
We are going to use deep learning models to predict which subject does a paper belong to based on its abstract. Subjects include Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Statistics, Biology, and Finance. We plan to use two models to train our dataset, tune each model invidually, and compare the accuracy rate of each model.


## Models

Model 1: BERT is an autoencoding transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. It works really well in scenarios like sentiment analysis, translation, and text classification.

Model 2: XLNET is a generalized autoregressive transformers model and is one of the best text classification models currently available. It is really good at acpturing dependencies between words, and thus is also very good at text classification
